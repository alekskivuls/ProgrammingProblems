Welcome to Day 20! Check out a video review of pointers, aliasing, garbage collection, and Java Virtual Machine, or just jump right into the problem. In the 30 Days of Code series, we haven't talked about StringTokenizer, but that's okay! Java users can dive into the StringTokenizer documentation, figure out what it can do, and solve this problem. You can do this!

And those of you that are not using Java can solve this challenge in many different ways in your favorite programming language.
